# Catalog

Catalog lets you create beautiful living style guides quickly and easily. Content is written in Markdown so you can focus on documenting your components. It is completely dependency free, making it trivial to integrate Catalog into your application.

Refer to the [documentation](http://interactivethings.github.io/catalog/) to find out more.
